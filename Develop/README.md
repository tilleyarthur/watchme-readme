README GENERATOR
DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this project is to generate a README.md file using node and terminal. Challenges I faced were linking each .js file together to be able to generate the readme on the command line. there are errors in the code, to be sure. However, I can see it is a useful tool to expedite the creation of a readme.md file.

INSTALLATION
Run 'npm init' in terminal. Run 'npm install'. If terminal prompts you to install the lastest version of npm, follow the instructions to do so. In order to run the readme generater, simply type node index.js

USAGE
Use this repository to help you generate a README.md file quickly and easily to expedite your project.
